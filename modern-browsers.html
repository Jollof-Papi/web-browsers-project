  <h2>HTML5 and the Modern Web Browser</h2>
  <p>Since its official release in 2014, <strong>HTML5</strong> has completely redefined how web browsers render and interact with content. Before HTML5, rich media relied heavily on third-party plugins like Flash or Java. With HTML5, media and complex interactions became natively supported, improving speed, security, and accessibility.</p>

  <p>One of HTML5's most notable features is the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tags. These enable native media playback across modern browsers—without plugins. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge all quickly adopted this feature, allowing platforms like YouTube to phase out Flash and improve device compatibility.</p>

  <p>Another breakthrough is the <strong>Canvas API</strong>, which allows developers to render 2D graphics dynamically within the browser. This opened the door to interactive games, real-time data visualizations, and creative web apps, powered by JavaScript engines like Chrome's V8 and Firefox’s SpiderMonkey.</p>

  <p>HTML5 also introduced <strong>semantic elements</strong> such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. These tags help search engines and screen readers better understand a page’s structure, enhancing both SEO and accessibility. Browsers evolved to render these complex layouts more efficiently, resulting in faster page loads and better user experiences.</p>

  <p>Perhaps most importantly, HTML5 helped transition browsers from document viewers to full application platforms. Tools like Google Docs, Figma, and even games like Minecraft Classic now run entirely in the browser. As a result, the gap between web pages and native apps continues to narrow, thanks to technologies like JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).</p>

    <h2>The Chrome Era</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome launched in 2008 with speed, security, and stability, surpassing competitors with its V8 JavaScript engine and sandboxing. Edge now uses the same Chromium base, while Safari remains Apple's standard.</p>

    <h2>Browser Security Evolution</h2>
    <p>Browsers moved from HTTP to HTTPS for secure data transfer, added phishing protection, sandboxing, and features like pop-up blocking and password managers to improve security and privacy.</p>

    <h2>Future of Browsers</h2>
    <p>Browsers will integrate AI for predictive searches, expand Progressive Web Apps, and support Web Assembly for near-native app performance, enhancing user experience and capability.</p>
